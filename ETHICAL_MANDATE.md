# Ethical Mandate for the NCD Stock-out Predictor Project

## Project Mission

The primary goal of this project is to use data science to improve health equity by ensuring consistent access to essential NCD medications for patients in Ghana. All technical work must serve this human-centered mission.

## Core Principles

1.  **Beneficence ("Do Good"):** The model's predictions should be used to proactively prevent stock-outs, directly benefiting patient health by ensuring continuity of care.
2.  **Non-Maleficence ("Do No Harm"):** We must be aware of potential biases in the data and the model. A model that is biased could lead to a misallocation of resources, inadvertently harming the very populations we intend to serve.
3.  **Fairness & Equity:** The system must be designed and evaluated to ensure it performs fairly across different geographic locations and patient populations.

## Potential Biases & Mitigation Strategies

Even though the current dataset is synthetic, we will operate as if it were real data from the DHIMS II system.

*   **Potential Bias: Representation Bias**
    *   **Description:** Data from urban clinics with better infrastructure and staffing may be more complete and accurate than data from rural or under-resourced clinics. A model trained on this data might perform poorly for rural clinics because it has not seen enough representative examples.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy for this Project:** During the EDA, we will analyze data completeness and distribution by clinic (if such data were available). In the modeling phase, we would evaluate the model's performance not just on overall accuracy, but on its fairness across different clinic types. Our `MODEL_INTERPRETABILITY_REPORT.md` will be a key tool to investigate if the model is relying on unfair proxies.

## Accountability

As the Principal Investigator, I am accountable for the ethical implications of this work. This mandate will be reviewed at each stage of the project lifecycle to ensure our technical decisions remain aligned with our ethical commitments.
