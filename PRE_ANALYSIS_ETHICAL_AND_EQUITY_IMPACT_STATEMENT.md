### 1.0 Project Mandate

This document serves as the foundational ethical framework for this research. The primary objective is to develop a proof-of-concept Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that improves health equity by ensuring consistent access to essential NCD medications. This statement is prepared *before* model development to ensure that ethical considerations and fairness metrics are treated as primary design constraints, not as secondary afterthoughts.

### 2.0 Core Ethical Principles

This project is governed by three core principles derived from established biomedical and AI ethics:

*   **Beneficence ("Do Good"):** The system's primary metric for success is not technical accuracy, but its potential to directly benefit patient health through improved continuity of care.
*   **Non-Maleficence ("Do No Harm"):** We acknowledge that a poorly designed or biased AI system can cause significant harm through the misallocation of critical resources. We commit to proactively identifying and mitigating these risks.
*   **Justice & Equity:** The system must be designed and evaluated with a primary focus on fairness. Its benefits should not disproportionately favor well-resourced clinics over rural or underserved ones.

### 3.0 Primary Equity Risk Analysis: Representation Bias

The most significant ethical risk in developing a predictive model for the Ghanaian health system is **Representation Bias**.

*   **Hypothesized Cause:** Data from urban health facilities with better infrastructure, consistent electricity, and more robust reporting practices is likely to be more complete and of higher quality than data from rural or under-resourced clinics.
*   **Potential Harm:** A model trained on this skewed data will inherently learn the patterns of well-functioning clinics. When deployed, it would likely perform poorly for rural clinics, systematically under-predicting their needs and exacerbating existing health inequities. This would cause the system to fail the very populations it is most intended to serve.

### 4.0 Defined Mitigation Strategy

To address this primary risk, the following mitigation steps are integrated into the research protocol:

1.  **Bias in, Bias Out (Data Engineering):** The `1_Data_Cleaning_and_EDA.ipynb` notebook will include a specific section to analyze data completeness and distribution patterns across different (simulated) clinic types.
2.  **Fairness as a Metric (Model Evaluation):** The model will not be evaluated on aggregate accuracy alone. We will perform a **disaggregated evaluation**, measuring key metrics (e.g., Recall for stock-out events) independently for both "urban" and "rural" clinic archetypes in our dataset. A significant performance gap between these groups would indicate a failure of the fairness principle.
3.  **Transparency as a Tool (Interpretability):** The `CLINICAL_TRANSLATION_AND_INTERPRETABILITY_BRIEFING.md` will be used to investigate *why* the model makes certain predictions. We will use SHAP analysis to ensure the model is not using unfair proxies (e.g., "clinic location") as a primary driver for its risk assessments.
